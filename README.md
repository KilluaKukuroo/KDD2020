### SIGKDD Dissertation Award 

**Dissertation Award Running Up**: [Jingbo Shang](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io/), Assistant professor in UCSD, PHD from UIUC with Prof.Jiawei Han; 

In the speech, Prof.Shang introduced hsi work during PhD study about automatic learning from text: **turning upstructed data into structured knowledge**;

**QA**:

**1)How to improve our research taste? How to choose a good topic?**

I focused on three parts: *real problem; real data; real solution*. 

**If an algorithm is very specific, if we release some condition, the method will not work that well. So we have the chance to improve.**For example, for my PHD study, supervised learning on text is well studied, but i move to unsupervised learning, to form my phd thesis.

**2)What is your future research interest?**

two things, 

- week supervision. Utilize huge amount of unlabelled data;
- How to combine sturcture and unstructured data;

**Dissertation Award**: [Rediet Abebe](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~red/), Assistant Professor in UC Berkeley, PHD from Cornell University;

## Generate word_cloud based on paper keyword statistics

problem: 
- Many special keyword (e.g., Adversarial Network, neural network) are divided into two or more single word, which contradicts with the true situation;
- Case, singular and plural should not be sensitive;<br>
<img src="pic/KDD2020-keyword.png" alt="avatar" style="zoom:150%;" />

## Classify papers by topics

problem：
- Should be able to automatically find important topics in the title and abstract; (Human-crafted topics need domain knowledge, easy to omit topics, bad generalization ability)
- Should be able to cluster similar topics to form one keyword;

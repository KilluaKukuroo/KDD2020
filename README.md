## 5. KDD Awards

### 5.1 SIGKDD Dissertation Award 

**Dissertation Award Running Up**: [Jingbo Shang](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io/), Assistant professor in UCSD, PHD from UIUC with Prof.Jiawei Han; 

In the speech, Prof.Shang introduced his work during PhD study about automatic learning from text: **turning unstructured data into structured knowledge**; 

<img src="D:/科研材料/kdd2020/pic/autonet.png" alt="avatar" style="zoom:50%;" />

**QA**:

**1)How to improve our research taste? How to choose a good topic?**

I focused on three parts: *real problem; real data; real solution*. 

**If an algorithm is very specific, if we release some condition, the method will not work that well. So we have the chance to improve.**For example, for my PHD study, supervised learning on text is well studied, but i move to unsupervised learning, to form my phd thesis.

**2)What is your future research interest?**

two things, 

- week supervision. Utilize huge amount of unlabelled data;
- How to combine sturctured and unstructured data;

**Dissertation Award**: [Rediet Abebe](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~red/), Assistant Professor in UC Berkeley, PHD from Cornell University;
